1. Change the leaves generation on the tree so that some of the blocks are "regular" apple leaves, and some are flowering.
	- reduce the non-flowering leaves to AGE = 3 instead of AGE = 4; that way there are four growth stages, so the youngest stage will have flowers on it to indicate it becomes apples
	- make sure that after apple harvest, state gets restored to the flowering stage (which currently is AGE = 1, but will be AGE = 0)
	- may need to rename texture files as well

2. Add sapling drops to the leaves, for easier propagation

3. Add a custom wood type, along with
	- boat
	- fence & gate
	- signs & hanging signs
	- buttons
	- door & trapdoor
	- pressure plate
	- slabs & stairs
