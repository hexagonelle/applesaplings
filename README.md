<p><strong>Welcome to my first ever mod!</strong></p>
</div>


This mod was made with one goal in mind: apple saplings! You can now craft apple saplings by combining an apple and an oak sapling. The tree that grows will spawn with some flowering leaves. These leaves will grow over time. When they are mature, right-click to harvest the apple, which will reset the growth. The "regular" leaves will not grow apples, but unlike the flowering leaves they will drop apple saplings.\
\
In addition, the trees grow with applewood logs! You can use these to craft all your favorite blocks:
- Stripped Applewood Logs
- Applewood Wood & Stripped Applewood Wood
- Applewood Planks
- Signs & Hanging Signs
- Buttons & Pressure Plates
- Fences & Fence Gates
- Doors & Trapdoors
- Boats & Chestboats
